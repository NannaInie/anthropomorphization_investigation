| **Cognizer & Products of cognition** | Instead of language that locates thinking in an algorithm, describe the algorithm as performing calculations or other algorithmic operations and the people using it doing the thinking.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | *artificial intelligence* → *probabilistic automation*<br><br>*hybrid intelligence* → *augmented human intelligence*<br><br>*image recognition* → *image labeling*<br><br>*speech recognition* → *automatic transcription*<br><br>*the model shows bias* → *the model reflects bias*<br><br>*model mistakes* → *model errors*<br><br>*chatbots are good at …* → *chatbots are good for …* |
| **Emotion**                          | Ascribing emotions to computers, even speculatively or subtly, is not scientific. Should this arise in scholarly writing, it is worth looking at how the rhetorical goal could be achieved in some other way, or if it should in fact be abandoned.                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Communication**                    | Instead of verbs like *ask, say, inform, discuss*, use verbs appropriate to computers like *input* and *output*. Another strategy is to foreground the fact of simulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | *prompt* → *text input*<br><br>*answer* → *output*<br><br>*chatbot / conversational agent* → *conversation simulator*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Agent**                            | Turns of phrase that locate agency with a machine often serve to obfuscate the interests and goals of people. We suggest revising to locate agency with people or choosing less agentive verbs.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | *ChatGPT assisted students* → *the students used ChatGPT*<br><br>*revealing the solution* → *displaying the solution*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Human role analogy**               | Calling systems *tutor* or *co-creator* are overclaims that describe what a developer might wish they could develop—for those who want to replace people in these roles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Language that describes algorithms as tools that people use, rather than as human-like entities, more clearly indicates system functionality while also not telegraphing a plan to replace people.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Names and pronouns**               | When naming a system, be mindful that all writing about that system will invoke the name. Bestowing a human name entails anthropomorphizing the system every time it is discussed. Pronouns are chosen each time, but subtle choices—such as grouping algorithms and people under *you* or *them*—can anthropomorphize. Separating systems from people and avoiding collective pronouns is preferable. | *who’s right?* → *is the machine output correct?*<br><br>*they produce results* → *the team uses it [the system] to produce results*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Biological metaphors**             | When revising away from biological metaphors, ask how system functionality can be more precisely described to give readers a clearer sense of what is actually happening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | *neural networks* → *weighted networks*<br><br>*the model consumes data* → *data is used in setting model weights*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
